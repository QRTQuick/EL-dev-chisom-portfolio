                    <p>
                        I'm a passionate software engineer with <strong>4+ years of experience</strong> delivering 
                        high-quality solutions as a <strong>solo contractor</strong>. My expertise spans full-stack 
                        web development, system programming, and IoT solutions, with a proven track record of 
                        building scalable, production-ready applications for diverse clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my <strong>4 years of independent contracting</strong>, I've successfully 
                        completed projects ranging from enterprise web applications to embedded systems. 
                        I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating solutions that make a 
                        real impact. Whether it's optimizing database performance or building intuitive 
                        user interfaces, I approach every challenge with curiosity and attention to detail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why choose me as your contractor?</strong> I bring the reliability of 4 years 
                        of solo project delivery, deep technical expertise across multiple domains, and 
                        the ability to work independently while maintaining clear communication throughout 
                        the development process.
